## SCRIPTING

- Creating A Script File
  * 1- Go to the directory where you want to create the file
  * 2- Create the file (use the .sh extension)
  * 3- Open the file and add the bash path in the beginning (NOTE: Make sure you add this at the beginning of the line #!): /usr/bin/bash
  * 4- Input the commands you want the command-line to run when opening the file.
  * 5- Make sure you change ownership and file permissions to make the file executable.
  * 6- In order to execute the file add the following command:~$ ./script-name.sh

- NOTE: We're going to write the path for the shell file you're using, for every script that you write for that shell, which in this case is bash.
